            <h2>Road to Hire - Indian Land, SC</h2>
            <p>06 - 2018 to 11 - 2018</p>
          </div>

          <h3>Junior Developer</h3>

          <p>Road to Hire is a program that aims to teach young adults the skills they need in order to become a successful web developer. It lasts 4 to 5 months and it's very fast paced. They teach everything from basic html and css to React and building apis in Node.js. Not only do they teach the technical skills needed to get a job, they also teach all of the soft skills you'll need too. Below I'll list some of the things I learned during my time in Road to Hire.</p>

          <ul class="learnList">
            <li class="learnItem">I learned so many things from the program, including taking constructive criticism, public speaking, time management, and giving feedback.</li>

            <li class="learnItem">I started with basic HTML and CSS then learning alot about semantic html and accessibility.</li>

            <li class="learnItem">After getting html and css down, we began our journey into javascript. We started with very simple tasks such as some math equations using console logs and things like that.</li>

            <li class="learnItem">We took a break from straight javascript to learn sass. We learned sass after learning javascript so we could fully grasp using variables, mixins, partials, and the more difficult concepts sass has that regular css doesn't.</li>

            <li class="learnItem">We had a midterm where we had to recreate an older version of the mymove website from a sketch file. Once we did that, we started learning React.</li>

            <li class="learnItem">We've had multiple projects but the most difficult one was building an e-commerce website. We had to create a full website selling something and pull our products from a mysql database. We had to build the api and front end to support it. Ontop of all of that, we had to do user authentication with Auth0 and have a page that only admins can see.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Cashier</h3>

          <ul class="learnList">
            <li class="learnItem">I was hired as a cashier but they had me getting carts, stocking, organizing the back, train new employees, run customer service, and zoning anywhere they needed. I pride myself on being very adaptable and easy to work with.</li>
